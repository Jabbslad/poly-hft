{"id":"poly-hft-ya9","title":"Complete signal generator implementation","description":"## Description\nComplete the signal generator to produce actionable trading signals by comparing fair value from GBM model against market prices.\n\n## Technical Details\n- Combine BTC spot price from Binance feed with Polymarket order book\n- Use GBM model to calculate P(up) fair value\n- Compare against best bid/ask to determine edge\n- Apply signal filters before emitting\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `src/signal/detector.rs` - Signal detection logic (partially implemented)\n- `src/signal/filter.rs` - Signal filtering (implemented, may need tuning)\n\n## Data Flow\n1. Receive PriceTick from Binance feed\n2. Receive OrderBook from Polymarket WebSocket\n3. Calculate fair value using GbmModel\n4. Compute edge = fair_value - market_price\n5. Apply filters (edge threshold, liquidity, volatility, time-to-expiry)\n6. Emit Signal if filters pass\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Signal detector combines spot price and order book\n- [ ] Fair value calculated correctly using GBM model\n- [ ] Edge computed against best bid (for YES) or best ask (for NO)\n- [ ] All configured filters applied\n- [ ] Signals emitted via channel to execution engine\n- [ ] ≥75% test coverage\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires: Gamma API client (market discovery)\n- Requires: Polymarket WebSocket (order book)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-04T12:20:43.573867778Z","created_by":"jabbslad","updated_at":"2026-01-04T12:20:43.573867778Z","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"poly-hft-ya9","depends_on_id":"poly-hft-mlm","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-04T12:20:50.198328105Z","created_by":"jabbslad"},{"issue_id":"poly-hft-ya9","depends_on_id":"poly-hft-ug0","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-04T12:20:50.220198111Z","created_by":"jabbslad"},{"issue_id":"poly-hft-ya9","depends_on_id":"poly-hft-ker","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-04T12:20:50.238935756Z","created_by":"jabbslad"}]}
